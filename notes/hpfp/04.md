# 4 Basic Datatypes

## 4.2 What are types?

**Types**: Haskell has expressions. Type the number `1` into the REPL That's an
expression. Type `addOne = (+) 1`. The function `addOne` is also an expression.
Try to imagine all the possible expressions we could type into GHCi. This is
hard to do because the number of possible expressions is infinite.  But if we
try to imagine lots of different expressions, we should start to notice
patterns. `1` is an expression, so is `2`, so is `3`, and so on. All positive
integers are expressions. `-1` is an expression, so `-2` and `-3`. Negative
integers, and therefore all integers are expressions.  The pair `(1,1)` is an
expression, so is `(1,2)`, so is `(23,58982)`. All pairs of integers are
expressions. We can keep going like this forever, finding new patterns of ways
to group expressions together. Every time we find a new expression-pattern, if
we can precisely describe the structure of that pattern, we have a type.

When we played with the `String` type in the preceding chapter, we were,
in effect, saying "Let's for the moment
think about only those expressions that have the `String` pattern, which looks
like this:

```haskell
data String = [Char]
data [] a = [] | a : [a]
```

Haskell mandates that expressions have types, and the compiler will not let us
run code where the types do not match up.

Try running:

```haskell
Prelude> not "foo"

<interactive>:4:5: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Bool’ with actual type ‘[Char]’
    • In the first argument of ‘not’, namely ‘"foo"’
      In the expression: not "foo"
      In an equation for ‘it’: it = not "foo"
Prelude> :type not
not :: Bool -> Bool
```

`not` is a function which takes a `Bool` and returns a `Bool`. If we
try to call `not` with a `String` we get a type error. Our expression
was not "well-typed."

We can also define new patterns, like

```haskell
data Grocery = Milk | Eggs | Flour
```

So the type system is a tool for defining new patterns in the space
of possible expressions, and then checking that in the code we want to
run, all the types fit together perfectly.

If you have ever played with Legos, you already have an intuition for
how this ought to work.

There are a lot of different ways to fit Lego' together. Two standard two by
four Lego bricks of the same color can be combined 24 ways (ignoring
symmetries). But there are also a lot of ways that you can't fit pieces
together. You can't, for example, place a brick on top of two adjacent bricks
at different heights. No amount of force will get the pieces to bend (Lego's are
very tough) that way. You can't "coerce" Lego's into doing whatever you want.
The shapes are what they are, and it's up to you the builder to figure out
some interesting way to fit them together.

Haskell expressions are like Lego pieces. And types are like their shapes.
But unlike with Lego's, you get to design entirely new pieces, as well
as put them together.

## 4.3 Anatomy of a data declaration

In the data declaration:

```haskell
data Bool = False | True
```

It's important to keep in mind that everything to left of the `=` are
types, and everything to the right are expressions.

```haskell
Prelude> data Bool = False | True deriving Show
Prelude> False
False
Prelude> Bool

<interactive>:6:1: error: Data constructor not in scope: Bool
Prelude> :type False
False :: Bool
Prelude> :info Bool
data Bool = False | True  -- Defined at <interactive>:4:1
instance [safe] Show Bool -- Defined at <interactive>:4:35
Prelude>
```

`Bool` and `False` live in two different spaces. `Bool` lives in type-space
and `False` lives in data-space. This is a really important distinction!
Type-space disappears after code gets compiled, so you can't interact with
them in running code (or "runtime").

**compile-time**: When code gets compiled. Types are used in compile-time,
but not in runtime. Compiler errors happen at compile-time.

**run-time**: When code gets run. Haskell types vanish at run-time. A run-time
error might be an exception like:

```haskell
Prelude> head []
*** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list
```

Another thing to remember is that since type-space and data-space are distinct,
the same name can live in both spaces:

```haskell
Prelude> data Thing a = Thing a deriving Show
Prelude> Thing 1
Thing 1
Prelude> Thing 1 :: Thing Integer
Thing 1
```

`Thing` the data constructor lives in data-space:

```haskell
Prelude> :t Thing
Thing :: a -> Thing a
```

And `Thing` the type constructor lives in type-space:

```haskell
Prelude> :i Thing
data Thing a = Thing a  -- Defined at <interactive>:24:1
instance [safe] Show a => Show (Thing a)
  -- Defined at <interactive>:24:33
```

But this is just two names that happen to be the same. We could equivalently
say:

```haskell
Prelude> data Thing a = MakeThing a deriving Show
```
and everything behaves the same:

```haskell
Prelude> data Thing a = MakeThing a deriving Show
Prelude> Thing 1

<interactive>:5:1: error:
    Data constructor not in scope: Thing :: Integer -> t
Prelude> MakeThing 1
MakeThing 1
Prelude> :t Thing

<interactive>:1:1: error: Data constructor not in scope: Thing
Prelude> :t MakeThing
MakeThing :: a -> Thing a
Prelude> :i Thing
data Thing a = MakeThing a  -- Defined at <interactive>:4:1
instance [safe] Show a => Show (Thing a)
  -- Defined at <interactive>:4:37
Prelude>
```

### Exercises: Mood Swing
1. `Mood`
2. `Blah` or `Woot`
3. Woot is a value whose type is Mood, should be `changeMood :: Mood -> Mood`
4. Example:
```haskell
-- Mood.hs
module Mood where
data Mood = Woot | Blah deriving Show

changeMood :: Mood -> Mood
changeMood Blah = Woot
changeMood Woot = Blah
```

5. see 4.

## 4.4 Numeric types

Numeric types will not completely make sense without typeclasses.

**Typeclass**: A collection of types that share common properties.
For example, the typeclass `Show` is defined as

```haskell
Prelude> :i Show
class Show a where
  showsPrec :: Int -> a -> ShowS
  show :: a -> String
  showList :: [a] -> ShowS
  {-# MINIMAL showsPrec | show #-}
  -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
```

Which is for our purposes equivalent to:

```haskell
class Show a where
  show :: a -> String
```

So any type that is an instance of `Show` has a function called `show`
that lets you turn a value of that type into a `String`.

Let's try it:

```haskell
Prelude> data Something = Something
Prelude> instance Show Something where show Something = "Something"
Prelude> show Something
"Something"
```

Of course, this is tedious, so Haskell gives us a `deriving` mechanism
that does effectively this:

```haskell
Prelude> data Something = Something deriving show
Prelude> show Something
"Something"
```

The reason this is relevant is that `Num`, `Fractional` and `Integral` are
all typeclasses, not types:

```haskell
Prelude> :i Num
class Num a where
  (+) :: a -> a -> a
  (-) :: a -> a -> a
  (*) :: a -> a -> a
  negate :: a -> a
  abs :: a -> a
  signum :: a -> a
  fromInteger :: Integer -> a
  {-# MINIMAL (+), (*), abs, signum, fromInteger, (negate | (-)) #-}
    -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’

Prelude> :i Fractional
class Num a => Fractional a where
  (/) :: a -> a -> a
  recip :: a -> a
  fromRational :: Rational -> a
  {-# MINIMAL fromRational, (recip | (/)) #-}
    -- Defined in ‘GHC.Real’
Prelude> :i Integral
class (Real a, Enum a) => Integral a where
  quot :: a -> a -> a
  rem :: a -> a -> a
  div :: a -> a -> a
  mod :: a -> a -> a
  quotRem :: a -> a -> (a, a)
  divMod :: a -> a -> (a, a)
  toInteger :: a -> Integer
  {-# MINIMAL quotRem, toInteger #-}
    -- Defined in ‘GHC.Real’
```

But this is getting pretty deep into the "typeclass zoo." Better leave this
for chapters 5 and 6.

## 4.6 Go on and Bool me

### Exercises: Find the Mistakes

1. `not True && True`
2. `not (x == 6) where x = 5`
3. `(1 * 2) > 5`
4. `["Merry"] > ["Happy"]`
5. `["1, 2, 3"] ++ "look at me!"`


## 4.9 Chapter Exercises

1. `length :: [a] -> Int`

2.  a. 5
    b. 3
    c. 2
    d. 5

3. `Int` is not a `Fractional`
4. Use infix ```div` `` instead
5. `Bool`, returns `True`
6. `Bool`, returns `False`
7.  a. Works, `False`
    b. Error, no instance `(Num Char)`
    c. Works, returns `8`
    d. Works returns `False`
    e. No instance `(Num Bool)`

8.  Files
    ```haskell
    isPalindrome :: (Eq a) => [a] -> Bool
    isPalindrome x = reverse x == x
     ```

9.  File:
    ```haskell
    myAbs :: Integer -> Integer

    ```

10.  File:
     ```haskell
     -- Exercise10.hs
     module Exercise10 where

     f :: (a, b) -> (c, d) -> ((b, d), (a, c))
     f x y = ((snd x, snd y), (fst x, fst y))
     ```

### Correcting syntax

1.  File:

    f = (\x -> x)
    ```

3.  File:
    ```haskell
    -- CorrectingSyntax3.hs
    module CorrectingSyntax3 where

    f (a, b) = a
    ```

### Match the function names to their types

1.  c.
2.  b.
3.  a.
4.  d.
