# 6 Typeclasses

## 6.2 What are typeclasses?

"Typeclasses and types in Haskell are, in a sense, opposites".

Sentences like these frustrate me. You can say nearly anything is the case
"in a sense:"

"In a sense, the Moon really is made of cheese." In the sense of poetic whimsy.

"In a sense, Johnny is at the top of his class." In unexcused absences and
missed assignments.

This is just some plain old fashioned jesuitical casuistry. Annoying.

"In a sense, typeclasses and types are the same." In the sense that they both
specify and constrain the properties of expressions.

If an expression's type is an instance of `Eq` it means there's a way to
define to define and equals function `(==)` to check if two expressions
of that type are equal:

```
Prelude> :info Eq
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  {-# MINIMAL (==) | (/=) #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
```

But there are types that it is impossible to define `(==)` for! The
function constructor `(->)`, for example, cannot be an instance of `Eq`. Why?
The Halting Problem! If there's no general way to test whether a function
will halt on a given input, there's certainly no general way to determine
whether two functions will do the same thing (run forever or return the
same value) for a given input.

So typeclasses constrains the potential things types can be by specifying
what they can do.

Some typeclasses and their relationships:

## Exercises: Eq Instances

1.  ```
    instance Eq TisAnInteger where (==) TisAn x TisAn y = (==) x y
    ```
2.  ```
    instance Eq TwoIntegers where Two x y == Two p q = (x, y) == (p, q)
    ```

3.  String or Int:

    ```
    instance Eq StringOrInt where
    TisAnInt x == TisAnInt y = x == y
    TisAString x == TisAString y = x == y
    _ == _ = False
    ```
4.  ```
    instance Eq Pair where Pair a b == Pair x y = (a, b) == (x, y)
    ```

5.  ```
    instance Eq Tuple where Tuple a b == Tuple x y = (a, b) == (x, y)
    ```

6.  Which

    ```
    instance Eq a => Eq (Which a) where
    ThisOne x == ThisOne y = x == y
    ThatOne x == ThatOne y = x == y
    _ == _ = False
    ```

7.  EitherOr

    ```
    instance (Eq a, Eq b) => Eq (EitherOr a b) where
    Hello x == Hello y = x == y
    Goodbye x == Goodbye y = x == y
    _ == _ = False
    ```

## Exercises: Tuple Experiment

`quotRem` and `divMod` return a tuple with the values from `quot` and `rem` or
`div` and `mod` respectively.

## Exercises: Will They Work?

1. `5`
2. `LT`
3. error, a string and a bool are not comparable
4. `False`

## Chapter Exercises

### Multiple choice

1. c
2. b
3. a
4. c
5. a

### Does it typecheck?:

1.  ch6/ex1.hs
2.  ch6/ex2.hs

3.  a. any `Mood`, i.e. `Blah` or `Woot`
    b. type error, `9` is not a `Mood`
    c. `Mood` does not derive `Ord`

4.  ch6/ex4.hs

### Given a datatype declaration, what can we do?
exdatatype.hs

1. `"chases"` and `True` are a `String` and a `Bool`, not a `Rocks` and a `Yeah`
2. works
3. works
4. `Papu` isn't an instance of `Ord`

### Match the types:

exmatch1.hs and exmatch2.hs

1. Since `i = 1`, `i` has to be a `Num`, it can't be a type that `1` isn't,
like e.g.  a `String`. We can't cast `i` upwards.
2. `1.0` is not just any instance of `Num`, the syntax implies `Fractional`.
3. works
4. works
5. works, we can always cast downwards
6. works
7. Doesn't work, `sigmund` returns `myX` which is an `Int`
8. Doesn't work, `sigmund'` returns an `Int` not any instance of `Num`
9. Works, restricts `jung` to a list of `Ints` rather than any list
10. Works, restricts input to `String`
11. Doesn't work, `mySort` only sorts `Strings`, not any instance of `Ord`

### Type-Kwon-Do: Electric Typealoo

1. `chk f a b = f a == b`
2. `arith f n a = (+ fromIntegral n) (f a)`
