# Contact

The best way to reach me is through email. My email address is my
initials at this domain. My initials are three letters which can
at the top left corner of this page in the header bar. The domain is the
"something".com in the URL bar just above that. Sorry to be cryptic,
but, as St. Peter once said: "Your enemy the spambot prowls around like a 
roaring lion, seeking addresses to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith and 
in your Turing Tests."[^1] 

If any reason this doesn't work for you, please file an issue at this website's
