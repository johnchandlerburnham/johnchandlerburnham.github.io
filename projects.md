# Textbook Notes

Note that many of these notes are "incomplete" in the sense that not all
chapters have been annotated equally, and not all books have been finished cover
to cover. I read a lot of books that way. Usually I take notes where I *don't*
understand something and need the extra help of working through things out
loud.
